                        Men outnumber women in the tech industry 3 to 1, and only 21% of graduates in a technology related field are women. Only 9% of that population pursue a career in development. This may be in part due to the overwhelming amount of information surrounding these careers, making the career path seem daunting to go in to. Web development may just be the most approachable option.

                        After digging though some articles and blogs on the topic of women in tech, I came to realize that although many women may be overwhelmed learning web design and development at first, talking to people and being involved in development communities showed them that this is something that they could not only do, but also enjoy doing. It also became apparent that a major concern for potential female web students was the technical hurdles they would have to overcome. However, building the internet as we know it is not a 100% math and science game.

                        A common misconception for women is that you may have to be more math or science inclined to pursue a career in web because they may not have the ability to do the work. However, all aspects of web creation ten to get lumped into the “IT/Technical Skills” category, which is not necessarily accurate and may be scaring people off.  Digital design makes up a large portion of web development opportunities, and many women have found that by pursuing the design aspects of a career in web, an interest and a passion for the development and programming aspects came with the territory.

                    <p>
                        Another issue for women pursuing careers in tech may be the simple fact that the industry is male dominated. Although this can bring up issues, many articles and YouTube videos made by female developers bring some important facts to light that may encourage potential future candidates. In an industry with so much opportunity and so many potential paths to follow, if things aren’t working out in one specific situation it’s easy enough to move on to the next big thing. Even in an industry that has a high male population, women don’t necessarily find it difficult to find a place in the web community. The consensus is that talent speaks louder than gender. If you do good work, you’ll find success.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It is important for women to feel confident in pursuing careers in tech as there may be consequences of their absence in a field with so much impact on society. It is estimated that by 2020, 1.4 million computer science jobs will become available, with only enough graduates to fill 29% of these jobs, less than 3% being women. Web development and design is a fantastic entry point due to it’s approachability and the community support behind it.
